# COSBench Manta Adaptor

This project provides an [adaptor](https://github.com/intel-cloud/cosbench/blob/master/COSBench-Adaptor-Dev-Guide.odt)
for benchmarking [Joyent's object store](https://www.joyent.com/object-storage) [Manta](https://github.com/joyent/manta)
using [COSBench](https://github.com/intel-cloud/cosbench/).

## Requirements
* [COSBench 0.4.1.0 or later](https://github.com/intel-cloud/cosbench/releases/tag/v0.4.1.0)
* [Java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or higher.
* [Maven 3.3.x](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Building from Source
If you prefer to build from source, you'll also need
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), and then invoke:

``` bash
# mvn package
```

This should generate an OSGI bundle inside the `./target` directory that you
can drop into the COSBench `osgi/plugins`` directory.

## Configuration

Sample COSBench job configuration files are available in the `./docker_buikd/opt/cosbench/conf` directory.

You can configure the COSBench parameters using environment variables, java system properties or directly in the
workload configuration file. See the [Java Manta driver](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta) documentation for
details.

You can specify any of the system properties used in the [Java Manta driver](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta)
in the config element of the workload configuration. In addition to those properties you can also specify a few more.

*COSBench Properties*

|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| true                                 | logging                   |
| 1                                    | no-of-http-range-sections |
|                                      | object-size               |
| 2                                    | durability-level          |
| false                                | chunked                   |
| stor/cosbench                        | manta-directory           |

| false                                | multipart                 |

For benchmarking purposes, changing `chunked`, `durability-level`, 
`http.signature.native.rsa`, `manta.http_buffer_size`, `manta.verify_uploads`,
`manta.upload_buffer_size` or `https.cipherSuites` can have an impact 
on overall performance.

### Testing HTTP Range Requests

If you want to test the performance of HTTP byte range requests, you will need
to set the COSBench property `no-of-http-range-sections` to a value greater
than one **and** set the property `object-size` to the size of object you are
testing (this is redundant information, but there is no way for the Manta 
Adaptor to get the information from COSBench). The property 
`no-of-http-range-sections` indicates the number of separate HTTP range requests
to make in order to download a single file.

### Testing Client Side Encryption

## Docker Stand Alone
You can use a preconfigured host with COSBench and the Manta adaptor preinstalled
when you run the project's [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image:
[`dekobon/cosbench-manta`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dekobon/cosbench-manta/).

Using Docker on your local machine you can log into a COSBench system setup for
Manta by doing:

```
# Adjust the key paths if needed and be sure to specify your own MANTA_USER
docker run --name=cosbench \
           -e "MANTA_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" \
           -e "MANTA_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa | base64 -w0)" \
           -e "MANTA_URL=https://us-east.manta.joyent.com:443" \
           -e MANTA_USER=username \
           -p 18088:18088 -p 19088:19088 \
           -it dekobon/cosbench-manta:latest bash
```

Using Triton on the Joyent public cloud you can log into a COSBench system setup for
Manta by doing:
```
# Adjust the key paths if needed and be sure to specify your own MANTA_USER
# This will create a container with a 8gb memory package size and size the
# JVM to fit within that range
docker run --name=cosbench \
           -d \
           -e "MANTA_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" \
           -e "MANTA_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa | base64 -w0)" \
           -e "MANTA_URL=https://us-east.manta.joyent.com:443" \
           -e MANTA_USER=username \
           -e "JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx7500m" \
           -m 8g \
           -p 18088:18088 -p 19088:19088 \
           --restart=always \
           -it dekobon/cosbench-manta:latest sleep infinity          
```

Note: you will **need** to specify the Manta environment variables in order for
the Manta adaptor to work correctly. You can override or add to the configuration
within the workload configuration, but you can't embed public nor private keys
in that configuration, so you will ultimately have to set some of these environment
variables. Also, please note that we did a base64 with no line endings for the
private key.

Using this configuration you will be able to run the COSBench startup script by:
```
cd /opt/cosbench
sh ./start-all.sh

# If I am on Triton, it would be useful to note the public IP address
ifconfig

# When I want to shut down:
sh ./stop-all.sh
```

Then you will be able to go to the driver control panel ([http://server:18088/driver/index.html](http://localhost:18088/driver/index.html)) or the
more useful controller control panel ([http://server:19088/controller/](http://localhost:19088/controller/)).
From the controller control panel, you can run a benchmark by submitting a new workload.
The workload configuration `opt/cosbench/conf/manta-config.xml` is a good
example to get started with.

## Docker Compose on Triton

If you would like to easily run COSBench at scale, you can using Joyent's
[Triton](https://www.joyent.com/triton) with Docker compose. To get started,
you will need to create a `_env` file.

This file should look like:
```
MANTA_USER=username
MANTA_URL=https://us-east.manta.joyent.com:443 (or private manta URL)
MANTA_PUBLIC_KEY=public ssh key for accessing Manta
MANTA_PRIVATE_KEY=private ssh key for accessing manta in base64 -w0 format
```

For the `MANTA_PRIVATE_KEY` setting value, you will need to convert your private
key to a single line of base64 encoded characters. You would do this by:

```
cat ~/.ssh/private_key_path | base64 -w0 
```

Once you have those settings in your _env file, make sure you have the
Docker tools installed (docker and docker compose). Next, make sure that you
have the [Triton CLI utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/triton) installed 
and the [JSON CLI utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/triton):

```
npm install -g triton json
```

If you haven't enabled CNS in your account setting, go and do that next.
Make sure that your SDC_URL and your DOCKER_HOST are both pointing to the same
Triton datacenter. Next, run the `./setup.sh` script to write the CNS name for 
consul to your `_env` file.

Now, start up docker-compose:
```
docker-compose -p cos up -d
```

Find the public CNS name for the controller instance:
```
echo "http://$(triton instance get -j cos_cosbench-controller_1 | json .dns_names | cut -d\" -f2 | grep '^cosbench-controller\.svc.*triton.zone$'):19088/controller/"
```

Go to the link returned from the above command and inspect that the driver was
populated in the controller. Now, let's scale up some more drivers:

```
docker-compose -p cos scale cosbench-driver=10
```

Once all of the drivers have started, refresh the controller dashboard and you
should see the drivers appear.

You now can dynamically scale many COSBench drivers. However, you will only have
a single controller node.

## OSGI Notes

You will need to add the following system property to the Java command that starts the OSGI
framework in order for the COSBench driver for Manta to work:

```
org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra=sun.misc,sun.reflect

```

## Contributions

Contributions welcome! Please ensure that `# mvn checkstyle:checkstyle -Dcheckstyle.skip=false` runs
clean with no warnings or errors.

## Testing

There are no unit tests for this project yet. This would be a great first contribution!

## Releasing the Java Components

In order to release to [Maven central](https://search.maven.org/), you will need [an account] (https://issues.sonatype.org) with [Sonatype OSSRH](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html).
If you do not already have an account, you can click the signup link from the login screen
to begin the process of registering for an account.  After signing up, you will need to add
your sonatype credentials to your your maven settings file.  By default this settings file is
located at `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml`.  In addition to sonatype credentials, you will
also need to add a [gpg signing](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/sign-mojo.html) key configuration.

For the security conscious, a [guide to encrypting credentials in maven settings files](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html) exists to
illustrate how credentials can be protected.

The following is an example settings.xml file:

```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                              http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>gpg</id>
      <properties>
        <!-- Customize the following properties to configure your gpg settings. -->
        <gpg.executable>gpg</gpg.executable>
        <gpg.keyname>keyname</gpg.keyname>
        <gpg.passphrase>passphrase</gpg.passphrase>
        <gpg.secretKeyring>${env.HOME}/.gnupg/secring.gpg</gpg.secretKeyring>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>username</username>
      <password>password</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

To perform a release:

1. Make sure the source builds, test suites pass, and the source and java artifacts can
 be generated and signed:
`mvn clean verify -Prelease`
2. Start from a clean working directory and make sure you have no modified
files in your workspace:
`mvn clean && git status`
3. Prepare the release:
4. `mvn release:clean release:prepare`
4. Enter the version to be associated with this release.
You should be prompted for this version number, and the default assumed version
will be shown and should correspond to the version that was in the pom.xml
file but WITHOUT the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix.
5. Enter the SCM tag to be used to mark this commit in the SCM.
You should be prompted for this tag name, and the default will be
`{projectName}-{releaseVersion}`
6. Enter the new development version.
You should be prompted for this version number, and the default for this will
be an incremented version number of the release followed by a `-SNAPSHOT`
suffix.

 At this point
 * The release plugin will continue and build/package the artifacts.
 * The pom.xml file will be updated to reflect the version change to the release
version.
 * The new pom.xml will be committed.
 * The new commit will be tagged.
 * The pom.xml file will be updated again with the new development version.
 * Then this new pom.xml will be committed.

 If the process fails for some reason during any of these points, you can invoke
`mvn release:rollback` to go back to the preparation point and try again, but
you will also have to revert any SCM commits that were done
(`git reset --hard HEAD^1` command works well for this) as well as remove any
tags that were created (`git tag -l && git tag -d <tagName>` commands help
with this).

7. Push tags to github:
`git push --follow-tags`
In order for the `release:perform` goal to complete successfully, you will need to
push the tags created by the maven release plugin to the remote git server.

8. Perform the actual release:
`mvn release:perform`
A build will be performed and packaged and artifacts deployed to the sonatype
staging repository.

9. Log into the [Sonatype OSSHR Next](https://oss.sonatype.org) web interface
to [verify and promote](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html)
the build.

**NOTE**: By default, these instructions assumes the release is being done from a
branch that can be merged into a primary branch upon successful completion,
and that the SCM operations that are carried out by maven plugins will NOT
access the repo, but rather, work on a local copy instead.  The release plugin
as configured in the maven repo sets values for this assumption
(`localCheckout=true` and `pushChanges=false`).

**NOTE**: If the release is being done in a separate fork of the primary
github repo, doing a merge via pull request will not also copy the tags that
were created during the release process.  The tags will have to be created in
the primary repo separately, but this may be preferred anyway.
